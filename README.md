### [> Download latest version...](https://github.com/hai-vr/av3-expressions-menu-hierarchy-editor/releases)

*Expressions Menu Hierarchy Editor* lets you edit Avatars 3.0 menus as if they were objects in your scene hierarchy, letting you edit the menu more easily by duplicating and moving items around.

Additional functionality includes automatically disabling items in the menu when your Expression Parameters does not support it, and generating icons.
